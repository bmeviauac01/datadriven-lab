# Query optimization

We will examine the query optimization behavior of Microsoft SQL Server. To properly understand the optimizer's behavior, in the **first 5 exercises**, we will explain the queries and the behavior too. The **rest of the exercises is individual work** where it is your task to infer the reason for a specific plan. Your task is to document the behavior and submit the documentation of **all** exercises in markdown format.

## Pre-requisites and preparation

Required tools to complete the tasks:

- Windows, Linux, or macOS: All tools are platform-independent, or a platform-independent alternative is available.
- Microsoft SQL Server
    - The free Express version is sufficient, or you may also use _localdb_ installed with Visual Studio
    - A [Linux version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup) is also available.
    - On macOS, you can use Docker.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other tool for writing markdown
- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms), or you may also use the platform-independent [VS Code MSSQL Extension](http://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-docs)
- Database initialization script: [mssql.sql](../db/mssql.sql)
- GitHub account and a git client

Materials for preparing for this laboratory:

- Markdown [introduction](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [detailed documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- Using Microsoft SQL Server: [description](https://bmeviauac01.github.io/datadriven/en/db/mssql/)
- The [schema](https://bmeviauac01.github.io/datadriven/en/db/) of the database
- [Microsoft SQL Server query optimization](../images/queryopt/07-Query-optimization.pdf) data driven course materials

## Initial steps

Keep in mind that you are expected to follow the [submission process](../GitHub.md).

### Create and check out your Git repository

1. Create your git repository using the invitation link in Moodle. Each lab has a different URL; make sure to use the right one!

1. Wait for the repository creation to complete, then check out the repository.

    !!! warning "Password in the labs"
        If you are not asked for credentials to log in to GitHub in university computer laboratories when checking out the repository, the operation may fail. This is likely due to the machine using someone else's GitHub credentials. Delete these credentials first (see [here](../GitHub-credentials.md)), then retry the checkout.

1. Create a new branch with the name `solution` and work on this branch.

1. Open the checked-out folder and type your Neptun code into the `neptun.txt` file. There should be a single line with the 6 characters of your Neptun code and nothing else in this file.

### Open the markdown file

Create the documentation in a markdown file. Open the checked-out git repository with a markdown editor. We recommend using Visual Studio Code:

1. Start VS Code.

1. Use _File > Open Folder..._ to open the git repository folder.

1. In the folder structure on the left, find `README.md` and double click to open.

   - Edit this file.
   - When you create a screenshot, put the file in this directory next to the other files. This will enable you to use the file name to include the image.

    !!! warning "File name: lowercase English alphabet only"
        You should avoid using special characters in the file names. Best if you use the English alphabet and no spaces either. The various platforms and git handle filenames differently. GitHub's web interface will only render the documentation with the images correctly if you only use all lowercase filenames with the English alphabet and no spaces.

1. For convenient editing open the [preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) (_Ctrl-K + V_).

!!! note "Alternative editor"
    If you do not like VS code, you can also use the [GitHub web interface](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository) to edit the markdown; you also have a preview here. [File upload](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) will be trickier.

### Create the database

1. Connect to Microsoft SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio. Start Management Studio and use the following connection details:

    - Server name: `(localdb)\mssqllocaldb` or `.\sqlexpress` (which is short for: `localhost\sqlexpress`)
    - Authentication: `Windows authentication`

1. Create a new database (if it does not exist yet). The name should be your Neptun code: in _Object Explorer_ right-click _Databases_ and choose _Create Database_.

1. Create the sample database by executing the [initializer script](../db/mssql.sql) Open a new _Query_ window, paste the script into the window, then execute it. Make sure to select the correct database in the toolbar dropdown.

    ![Selecting the database](../images/sql-management-database-dropdown.png)

1. Verify that the tables are created. If the _Tables_ folder was open before, you need to refresh it.

    ![Listing tables](../images/sql-managment-tablak.png).

### Getting the actual execution plan

!!! tip "If you are not using Windows"
    We are primarily using SQL Server Management Studio to get the execution plans. If you are not using Windows, you can also use VSCode MSSQL Extension to [obtain the query plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/visual-studio-code-extensions/mssql/mssql-extension-visual-studio-code?view=sql-server-ver16#query-results-pane).

We will check the query plan the optimizer chose and the server executed in the following exercises. In SQL Server Management Studio, open the _Query_ menu and check [_Include Actual Execution Plan_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/display-an-actual-execution-plan).

![Enable query plan](../images/queryopt/queryopt-include-plan.png)

The plan will be displayed after the query is completed at the bottom of the window on the _Execution plan_ pane.

![View query plan](../images/queryopt/queryopt-plan-result.png)

The plan is a data flow diagram where the query execution is the flow of the data. The items are the individual steps, and the percentages are the relative cost of each step with regards to the whole query.

## Exercises with solution drafts

!!! example "SUBMISSION"
    The submission shall be a documentation written in the `README.md` file:

    - document the SQL commands (if the exercise tells you to),
    - a screenshot of the query plan (just the plan and _not_ the entire desktop!),
    - and an explanation: _what_ do you see on the query plan and _why_ the system chose this option.

    The documentation should correctly display with the images in the web interface of GitHub! You need to verify this during the submission: open the repository in the browser and switch to your branch; GitHub will automatically render the `README.md` file with the images.

!!! danger "Submit your own work"
    Even though the solutions are provided below, you are required to execute the queries, get the execution plan, think about it, and document it with your own words. Copying the explanations from below is not acceptable!

If the query plan or the explanation of subsequent exercises is the same, or at least very similar, it is enough to document everything once (one screenshot and one reasoning); and list which (sub)exercises it is the solution for.

### Exercise 1 (2p)

Drop the `CustomerSite` => `Customer` foreign key and the `Customer` table primary key constraint. Find these in the _Object Explorer_ and delete them (the _PK..._ is the primary key while the _FK..._ is the foreign key - the ones you need to delete are in two different tables!):

![Delete constraint](../images/queryopt/queryopt-delete-key.png)

Execute the following queries on the `Customer` table and examine the execution plans (always fetch the entire records using `select *`):

- a) query the whole table
- b) get one record based on primary key
- c) querying records where the primary key is not a specified constant (use the `<>` comparison operation for not equals)
- d) querying records where the primary key is greater than a specified constant
- e) querying records where the primary key is greater than a specified constant, ordering by ID descending  

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

??? success "Solution draft"
    The SQL **queries**:

    - a) `select * from customer`
    - b) `select * from customer where id = 1`
    - c) `select * from customer where id <> 1`
    - d) `select * from customer where id > 1`
    - e) `select * from customer where id > 1 order by id desc`

    **a)-d)**

    The **execution plan** is indentical for all, it uses a _table scan_ each time:

    ![](../images/queryopt/f1-1.png)

    **Explanation**: the optimizer cannot use any index, as there is none. Thus there is no other choice but to use a _table scan_.

    **e)**

    This one is a little different due to the order by there is a sort stage too.

    ![](../images/queryopt/f1-2.png)

    **Explanation**: The _table scan_ is the same, and after that, there is still a need for sorting - without any index, it is a separate stage.

### Exercise 2 (2p)

Re-create the primary key of the `Customer` table:

- Right-click the table > Design > then right-click the ID column "Set Primary Key " then Save,
- or execute `ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Customer] ADD PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([ID] ASC)`

Re-run the same queries as in the previous exercise. What do you experience?

??? success "Solution draft"
    The commands are the same as before.

    **a)**

    ![](../images/queryopt/f2-1.png)

    The Clustered Index Scan iterates the table. We have a Clustered Index automatically created for the primary key, which has the records sorted by ID. By iterating through this index, all records are visited. This is almost identical to a Table Scan, though, not efficient. However, this is what we asked for here.

    **b)**
    
    ![](../images/queryopt/f2-2.png)

    A Clustered Index Seek is enough. Since the filter criteria is for the ID, for which there is an index available, the matching record can be found quickly. This is an efficient plan; the Clustered Index is used for the exact purpose we created it for.

    **c)**

    Similar to the previous one, a Clustered Index Seek between two intervals (`< constant`, `> constant`). Since the filter criteria still references the ID field with a Clustered Index, the query will use this index. This is an efficient query.

    **d)**

    Very similar to the previous one with a range filter.

    **e)**
    
    ![](../images/queryopt/f2-3.png)

    Clustered Index Seek with a backward seek order. The _Properties_ window shows the Seek Order-t: find the last matching record, and walk the index backward, which will yield a sorted result set.

### Exercise 3 (2p)

Execute the following queries on the `Product` table.

- f) query the whole table
- g) search for specific records where `Price` equals a value
- h) query records where `Price` is not a specified constant (<>)
- i) query records where `Price` is greater than a value
- j) query records where `Price` is greater than a value, ordered by `Price` descending

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

??? success "Solution draft"
    The SQL **commands**:

    - f) `select * from product`
    - g) `select * from product where price = 800`
    - h) `select * from product where price <> 800`
    - i) `select * from product where price > 800`
    - j) `select * from product where price > 800 order by price desc`

    **f)-i)**

    ![](../images/queryopt/f3-1.png)

    A Clustered Index Scan iterates through the contents of the index. This is still equal to reading the entire table since there is no index to match the filter criteria. Although a Clustered Index is used, it does not serve any purpose in filtering; all records are visited, and the filter is evaluated for each. These are not efficient queries, as the existing index is of no use.

    **j)**
    
    ![](../images/queryopt/f3-2.png)
    
    Still a Clustered Index Scan, but what is interesting is that cost of the sorting stage is quite large. Even after executing a costly Index Scan, we still have further sorting to do. A good index would help, but there is no index for the sorted column.

### Exercise 4 (2p)

Add a new non-clustered index on column `Price`. How do the execution plans change?

To add the index use _Object Explorer_, find the table, expand it, and right-click _Indexes_ -> _New index_ > _Non-Clustered Index..._

![Create index](../images/queryopt/queryopt-add-index.png)

Indices should have meaningful names, e.g., `IX_Tablename_Fieldname`. Add _Price_ column to the _Index key columns_ list.

![Index properties](../images/queryopt/queryopt-index-properties.png)

Repeat the queries from the previous exercise and explain the plans!

??? success "Solution draft"
    The SQL commands are the same as in the previous exercise.

    **f)**

    Despite the new index, it is still an Index Scan - since we asked for the contents of the entire table.

    **g)-i)**
    
    Clustered Index Scan iterating through the entire table, just as if there was no index available for the filtered column.
    
    Why does it not use the new index? The reason is the projection; that is, we query the entire record. The NonClustered Index could yield a set of record identifiers, after which the records themselves would still need to be queried. The optimizer decides that it is not worth doing so; an Index Scan is more efficient.

    **j)**
    
    ![](../images/queryopt/f4-1.png)
    
    The NonClustered Index Seek yields keys, which are looked up in the Clustered Index, just like joining the two indices.

    We would have expected something similar in the previous queries too. The Clustered Index is needed as entire records are fetched as the NonClustered Index only provides references. However, these references are in the correct order (the NonClustered Index ensures it); so after the lookup in the Clustered Index, there is no further need to do the sorting. If only the Clustered Index were used (Clustered Index Scan), the sorting would have to be performed in a separate stage. This is an acceptable query, as the NonClustered Index helps in avoiding a costly sorting step.

### Exercise 5 (2p)

Generate new records into the _Product_ table with the script below. How do the execution plans change?

When repeating the query for sub-exercise i), choose a constant value that will yield few resulting records, then choose a value that returns almost all records. Explain the differences!

```sql
SELECT TOP (1000000) n = ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID()))
INTO dbo.Numbers
FROM sys.all_objects AS s1 CROSS JOIN sys.all_objects AS s2
OPTION (MAXDOP 1);

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX n ON dbo.Numbers(n)
;


INSERT INTO Product(Name, Price, Stock, VATID, CategoryID)
SELECT 'Apple', n%50000, n%100, 3, 13
FROM Numbers
```

??? success "Solution draft"
    The SQL commands are the same.

    **f)**
    
    Same as before.

    **g)**
    
    ![](../images/queryopt/f5-1.png)

    References from the NonClustered Index Seek are looked up in the Clustered Index, just like joining the two indices.

    Let us compare this plan to the one from before having a smaller table. Why is the Clustered Index Scan not used now? In the case of larger tables, the _selectivity_ (i.e., how many records match the filtering) is more important, hence the use of the NonClustered Index. The Clustered Index Scan would be too costly in a large table. The NonClustered Index can reduce the number of records, hence its role here. Based on the statistics of the `Price` column, it can be derived that the `=` operator will match few records. Important! Just because it is an `=` comparison, it does not directly follow that there are few matches; imagine the column having the same value in all records. Hence the need for the statistics!
    
    This is an acceptable query. Since the filtering reduces the number of records, it is worth using the index.

    **h)**
    
    ![](../images/queryopt/f5-2.png)

    Clustered Index Scan as before.
    
    Why the difference compared to the previous case? If the `=` operator yields few matches, then `<>` will yield many. This is derived from the statistics too. So no use in doing the same as in the previous case; a Clustered Index Scan is probably more efficient.

    **i)**

    The plan depends on the constant. If it yields few matches, similar to g); otherwise the same as in h).

    **j)**
    
    Just like for g). Does the `order by desc` matter here? The optimizer tries to avoid sorting, and this is the only way to do so. This is an acceptable plan; by using the NonClustered Index there is no separate sorting stage.

## Individual exercises

!!! example "SUBMISSION"
    Continue documenting the results the same way.

    Keep in mind that the documentation should correctly display with the images in the web interface of GitHub! You need to verify this during the submission: open the repository in the browser and switch to your branch; GitHub will automatically render the `README.md` file with the images.

### Exercise 6 (1p)

Repeat the queries on the `Product` table, but instead of fetching the entire record, only get the `ID` and the `Price` columns. How do the execution plans change? Explain the differences!

### Exercise 7 (1p)

Analyze the following queries executed on the `Product` table:

- k) query records where the primary key is between two values (use the `BETWEEN` operator)
- l) query records where the primary key is between two values (use the `BETWEEN` operator), **or** it is equal to a value that falls outside of this range

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

### Exercise 8 (1p)

In exercise 6, `WHERE Price=` compared an integer and a floating-point number. Let us experiment with other comparisons: query records from the `Product` table with the following filter criteria.

- m) `where cast(Price as int) = integer number`
- n) `where Price BETWEEN integer number-0.0001 AND integer number+0.0001`

Choose a random integer number in these queries and fetch **only the primary key**. Analyze the execution plans.

### Exercise 9 (1p)

Analyze the following queries execute on the `Product` table:

- o) query entire records where `Price` is less than a constant value (the filter should yield few matches), ordered by ID descending
- p) the same, but fetch only `ID` and `Price`
- q) query entire records where `Price` is greater than a constant value (the filter should yield many matches), ordered by ID descending
- r) the same, but fetch only `ID` and `Price`

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

### Exercise 10 (1p)

Create a new index for the `Name` column and analyze the following queries executed on the `Product` table:

- s) query names and IDs where the name begins with B - use function [`SUBSTRING`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/substring-transact-sql)
- t) the same, but now using [`LIKE`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/like-transact-sql)
- u) query names and IDs where the name contains a B (LIKE)
- v) query the ID of a product where the name equals (=) a string
- w) the same, but now compare case-insensitively using [`UPPER`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/upper-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

### Exercise 11 (1p)

Analyze the following queries executed on the `Product` table:

- x) get the maximum of `Id`
- y) get the minimum of `Price`

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

### Exercise 12 (1p)

Query the number of products per category (`CategoryId`).

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!

### Exercise 13 (1p)

How could we improve on the performance of the previous query? Explain and implement the solution and repeat the previous query.

!!! tip "Tip"
    You need to add a new index. The question is: to which column?

### Exercise 14 (1p)

List the `Name` of each `Product` where `CategoryId` equals 2.

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan! Explain whether the index added in the previous exercises helps the performance.

### Exercise 15 (1p)

Improve the performance of the previous query. Extend the index added before by including the name: right-click the index -> _Properties_ -> and add `Name` to _Included columns_.

Repeat the previous query and analyze the plan.

## Optional exercises

**You can earn an additional +3 points with the completion of this exercise.**

### Exercise 16

Compare the following `Invoice`-`InvoiceItem` query: for each invoice item get the customer name.

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, Name
FROM Invoice JOIN InvoiceItem ON Invoice.ID = InvoiceItem.InvoiceID
```

Which _join_ strategy was chosen? Explain why the system chose it!

### Exercise 17

Compare the various JOIN strategies when querying all `Product`-`Category` record pairs.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Use [query hints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-join) or the [option command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/option-clause-transact-sql) to explicitly specify the join strategy.

    Put the 3 queries (each with a different join strategy) into one execution unit (execute them together). This will give you the relative cost of each option.

Document the SQL commands you used and explain the actual query execution plan!
